This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

The purpose of this React App is to demonstrate an ability to quickly learn typescript features and implement them into a basic react app.

Google API documentation states seems to dissuade users/developers from using IP addresses to determine GeoLocation. Instead of utilizing the Google Maps API, I utilized the https://www.geoplugin.com/ API to determine both the client public IP address and the client's location.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
